GeoLogix: AI-Driven Optimization for Last-Mile Logistics
GeoLogix is a data-driven project aimed at revolutionizing last-mile logistics using geospatial data and AI techniques. The project leverages clustering algorithms to optimize delivery routes, improve delivery efficiency, and analyze geospatial patterns in the logistics industry.

Key Features:
Geospatial Data: Analyzes (AMAZON'S) store and drop-off locations using latitude and longitude.
Clustering: Groups delivery locations to identify hotspots and optimize routes.
Delivery Time Analysis: Visualizes and explores delivery time distributions.
Route Optimization: Calculates geodesic distances for route optimization.
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, Geopandas
Folium
Scikit-learn (K-Means clustering)
Geopy
Objective:
GeoLogix aims to enhance the efficiency of last-mile delivery by applying AI to geospatial data, providing actionable insights for logistics optimization
